Every item, block or entity requires a `Behavior` file in the BP folder (to define how the item is going to behave) and a Resource file in the `RP` folder (to define how the item will look in-game).

Let's start off by creating our simple item's behavior file: `BP/items/gem.item.json` (In some steps, like this one, you will first need to create a folder before the file can be created).

## Gem Behavior Code (BP)

{% include filepath.html path="BP/items/gem.item.json" id="bp_gem_item" %}
```jsonc
{
	"format_version": "1.10",
	"minecraft:item": {
		"description": {
			"identifier": "tut:gem"
		},
		"components": {
			"minecraft:hand_equipped": false,
			"minecraft:stacked_by_data": true,
			"minecraft:foil": false,
			"minecraft:max_stack_size": 64,
			"minecraft:max_damage": 10
		}
	}
}
```

 - `format_version` defines what format the file uses. We'll be using 1.10.
 - `identifier` in `description` is used in blocks, recipes and entities. It will be used to define your item. For example, you can use /give with the identifier like this: `/give @s tut:gem`. The first part of the identifier is your pack's namespace. It's best to use the same namespace throughout your pack. It can be anything you like (e.g `kf:`, `jdot:`, `ve:`, `kai:`) providing it isn't too long. A namespace CANNOT be `minecraft:` or `minecon:`. The second part of the identifier is the name of the item, entity, recipe or block.
 - `components` are "qualities" the object always has. We'll look deeper into them when creating a custom entity. Let's break up everything in "components".
   - `minecraft:hand_equipped` defines whether the item 'equips' in your hand, this controls how the item is displayed on your character. For example, a Wooden Sword is hand equipped, but an Apple isn't.
   - `minecraft:stacked_by_data` defines whether this item with different aux values will be able to stack. For example
   - the item "minecraft:dye" with aux value 0, which is an Ink Sack (`/give @s dye  1 0`), doesn't stack with "minecraft:dye" with aux value 12, which is a Cocoa Bean (`/give @s dye 1 12`).
   - "minecraft:foil" defines whether the item will have the enchantment glint on it. An enchanted Shovel has this component set to true, but a disenchanted one to false.
   - `minecraft:max_stack_size` sets how many items can stack in a single inventory slot. Cannot be larger than 64. Set this to 1 for an unstackable item.
   - `minecraft:max_damage` can be not included, since it's for tools and weapons. It basically defines the item's durability and is rarely used in simple items.

For more information on components you can always refer to the documentation on [bedrock.dev/r/Item.](https://bedrock.dev/docs/stable/Item).

If you enter the game now, the item will function, but it will be invisible. You can test the functionality of your item by running `./give @s tut:gem`. Let's fix the invisibility by defining the items visuals in the RP folder.

## Gem Resource Code (RP)

{% include filepath.html path="RP/items/gem.item.json" id="rp_gem_item" %}
```jsonc
{
	"format_version": "1.10",
	"minecraft:item": {
		"description": {
			"identifier": "tut:gem",
			"category": "Nature"
		},
		"components": {
			"minecraft:icon": "gem",
			"minecraft:render_offsets": "tools"
		}
	}
}
```

- Set the same `identifier` under `description`, as in the item's behavior file.
- `category` defines the category of items of the item in creative inventory. It can be set to "Nature", "Equipment", "Construction" or "Items".
- Note that due to a bug items will not display in the Creative Inventory how they are supposed to, and you'll have to use `/give` to get them.
- Here are the components, explained:
  - `minecraft:render_offsets` defines how the item should be rendered. Can be set to pretty much any Vanilla item name, for example "apple".
  - `minecraft:use_animation` defines what animation to use when the player is using the item (Can be set to "bow", "eat", "drink", "crossbow", "camera"). It isn't needed in simple items, only foods and weapons.
  - `minecraft:icon` defines the item texture's short name. Let's look more into it.

## Gem Textures and Shortnames

In order to define your item texture's shortname (to be able to use the texture on an item), you first need to create the texture. Create a 16*16 image file, draw a gem on it, and save it into `RP/textures/items/gem.png`.

Now let's create the file where texture short names will be defined: `RP/textures/item_texture.json`, and copy this code into it:

{% include filepath.html path="RP/textures/item_texture.json" %}
```jsonc
{
	"resource_pack_name": "tut",
	"texture_name": "atlas.items",
	"texture_data": {
		"gem": {
			"textures": "textures/items/gem"
		}
	}
}
```

- `resource_pack_name` isn't important; you can set it to your identifier.
- Keep "texture_name" as "atlas.items".
- In the `texture_data` objects, you'll define all your item texture shortnames.
- `gem` is the short name for the "textures/items/gem" texture which you drew a few moments ago. This same `gem` is defined in `minecraft:icon` component of the Resource file of your item.

## Your gem is finished!

Done! If you did everything correctly, your gem can now be obtainable by `/give` in-game. If you're having trouble, watch your [Content Log](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/knowledge/troubleshooting.html#content-log). If the item still malfunctions, check out the example files.

# Custom food item: - creating an eatable 'Meal'

Creating a food item is very much the same as creating a simple item, except an additional component is needed in the item's behavior file. Let's get started by creating it as `BP/items/meal.item.json`. Here's the code: It looks very similar to the previous item's behaviors.

## Meal BP Code

{% include filepath.html path="BP/items/meal.item.json" id="bp_meal_item" %}
```jsonc
{
	"format_version": "1.12.0",
	"minecraft:item": {
		"description": {
			"identifier": "tut:meal"
		},
		"components": {
			"minecraft:hand_equipped": false,
			"minecraft:stacked_by_data": true,
			"minecraft:foil": false,
			"minecraft:max_stack_size": 64,
			"minecraft:use_duration": 32,
			"minecraft:food": {
				"nutrition": 4,
				"saturation_modifier": "normal",
				"can_always_eat": false,
				"effects": [{
						"name": "regeneration",
						"chance": 1.0,
						"duration": 5,
						"amplifier": 1
					},
					{
						"name": "absorption",
						"chance": 1.0,
						"duration": 120,
						"amplifier": 3
					}
				]
			}
		}
	}
}
```

- A new item needs a new `identifier`, but the same [namespace](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/concepts/namespaces.html).
- `minecraft:use_duration` defines how long the player will need to hold the 'use' button in order to consume the food
- `minecraft:food` is the component that makes the item a food item. Let's break it up:
  - `nutrition` means hunger points to be added when the player consumes the food.
  - `saturation_modifier` shows how long these will last. Can be set to "poor", "low", "normal", "high", "good", "max" and "supernatural";
  - `can_always_eat` defines if the player can eat the food even if their hunger bar is full. For Golden Apples this component is set to true, most other vanilla food is set to false.
  - `effects` are the status effects to be applied when the player consumes the food. It's pretty self explanatory: when the player consumes this item they'll get `Regeneration I` for 5 seconds and `Resistance III` for 120 seconds. This component is optional.

## Meal RP Code

{% include filepath.html path="RP/items/meal.item.json" id="rp_meal_item" %}
```jsonc
{
	"format_version": "1.10",
	"minecraft:item": {
		"description": {
			"identifier": "tut:meal",
			"category": "Nature"
		},
		"components": {
			"minecraft:icon": "meal",
			"minecraft:use_animation": "eat",
			"minecraft:render_offsets": "apple"
		}
	}
}
```

The preceding code goes in `RP/items/meal.item.json`, similarly to the Gem.

- `minecraft:use_animation` defines what animation to use when the player is using the item (Can be set to "bow", "eat", "drink", "crossbow", "camera"). It isn't needed in simple items, only foods and weapons.

## Meal Textures and Shortnames

{% include filepath.html path="RP/textures/item_texture.json" %}
```jsonc
{
	"resource_pack_name": "tut",
	"texture_name": "atlas.items",
	"texture_data": {
		"meal": {
			"textures": "textures/items/meal"
		},
		"gem": {
			"textures": "textures/items/gem"
		}
	}
}
```

And, lastly, let's create the texture as `RP/textures/items/meal.png` and set it's shortname to "meal" in `RP/textures/item_texture.json`.

Make sure to check out the current Item documentation for even more components on [bedrock.dev/r/Item!](https://bedrock.dev/docs/stable/Item)

# Setting Item Names

Your items should now show up in game, but they have weird names, which consist of their identifiers. For example, `tut:gem` shows up as `item.tut:gem.name`. To fix this, we need a `.lang` file in `RP/texts`. If you have US English set as your language in Minecraft settings, you'll need to name your text file `en_US.lang`. You can find file names for other languages in the example resource pack's texts folder. Paste the following "code" into res/texts/en_US.lang. Now your items will have the correct names:

{% include filepath.html path="RP/texts/en_US.lang" %}
```
item.tut:gem.name=Gem
item.tut:meal.name=Meal
```

[You can learn more about .lang here](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/concepts/lang.html)
