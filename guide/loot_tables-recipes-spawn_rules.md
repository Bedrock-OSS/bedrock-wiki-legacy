# Custom Loot Tables
Loot tables are powerful tools that define what blocks drop upon destruction, what entities upon death, what equipment can entities use, what can a player fish out of a river and what loot ends up in the game's loot chests. In order to understand loot tables better, I recommend looking into the `loot_tables` folder of the Example Vanilla Behavior pack, but I'll trow in some examples from there into here nevertheless.  \
One can even make a loot that drops half-removed blocks like glowingobsidian and netherreactors!

The most important thing in a loot table is the *file name*, since loot tables have no other identifier. They can be called by the path of the file in `BP/blocks/blockname.json/"minecraft:loot: {}"` for block loot, `BP/entities/entityname.json/"minecraft:loot: {}"` for entities and `BP/entities/entityname.json/"minecraft:equipment: {}"` for entity equipment (most hostile mobs use `low_tier_items.json`).\

If you want to change what can a player fish out of a jungle river, simply create your own loot table under `BP/loot_tables/gameplay/fishing/jungle_fish.json and BP/loot_tables/gameplay/fishing/jungle_junk.json` to overwrite the Vanilla loot tables. This can be done with most other Vanilla files too (if the aspect is data-driven).

You can also use `loot_tables.empty.json` for no loot.

Let's break up the Loot table structure somewhat. I took a simple zombie loot table as an example.

```jsonc
{
    "pools": [
        {
            "rolls": 1,
            "entries": [
                {
                    "type": "item",
                    "name": "minecraft:rotten_flesh",
                    "weight": 1,
                    "functions": [
                        {
                            "function": "set_count",
                            "count": {
                                "min": 0,
                                "max": 2
                            }
                        },
                        {
                            "function": "looting_enchant",
                            "count": {
                                "min": 0,
                                "max": 1
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "conditions": [
                {
                    "condition": "killed_by_player"
                },
                {
                    "condition": "random_chance_with_looting",
                    "chance": 0.025,
                    "looting_multiplier": 0.01
                }
            ],
            "rolls": 1,
            "entries": [
                {
                    "type": "item",
                    "name": "minecraft:iron_ingot",
                    "weight": 1
                },
                {
                    "type": "item",
                    "name": "minecraft:carrot",
                    "weight": 1
                },
                {
                    "type": "item",
                    "name": "minecraft:potato",
                    "weight": 1
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

- "`rolls`" defines how many times a random entry will be chosen from the following "`entries`" object.
- "`type`" can be set to either "`item`" or "`loot_table`" (to refer to an external loot table. For more information on that, check the Vanilla `BP/loot_tables/gameplay/fishing.json`).
- "`name`" only goes after `"type": "item"` and can be set to an item's full identifier, including the namespace.
- "`weight`" is the chance of this entry being chosen. The higher the weight in comparison to other entries in this "`entries`" array, the higher the chance of the entry being chosen.
- "`functions`" are what makes loot tables so powerful. They can do a lot, including setting the number of items dropped, enchanting the items(enchantments can even go on normally non-enchantable items that way), setting the items' names, the items' lores, and even writing books. \
For more information on functions check the example vanilla files or the unofficial Loot Table documentation, available [here](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bedrock_Edition_function/loot_tables/trade_tables_documentation).
- "`conditions`" can check for things like *"was the entity killed by a player?"* and *"was the sword enchanted with Looting III?"*. More info in them can be found in the resources listed above. \

*Blocks do not drop loot in creative mode*

**Note: it is possible to generate loot tables visually online. Check Links and Contact for the link to a reliable generator.**



***Challenge: Create custom loot tables for our custom blocks created in the previous chapter!***

# Custom crafting/smelting/etc Recipes

Recipes can have unique identifiers like `tut:compass_from_compass_block`. They're located in `BP/recipes`.

- The parameter below "`format_version`" defines the type of this recipe. It can be set to "`recipe_furnace`"(smelting), "`recipe_shaped`"(every ingredient has a set place in the crafting grid) and "`recipe_shapeless`"(ingredients can be placed in whatever order into the crafting grid).
- Every recipe takes "`tags`" which are a list of vanilla benches that can use this recipe. Can be "`crafting_table`", "`furnace`", "`smoker`", "`blast_furnace`", "`campfire`", "`stonecutter`" etc.
After b1.16.100 also accepts tags of custom benches.

Let's look through some recipe-specific syntax next.

### Smelting recipe example

```jsonc
{
  "format_version": "1.12",
  "minecraft:recipe_furnace": {
    "description": {
      "identifier": "minecraft:furnace_beef"
    },
    "tags": ["furnace", "smoker", "campfire"],
    "input": {
      "item": "minecraft:beef",
      "data": 0,
      "count": 4
    },
    "output": "minecraft:cooked_beef"
  }
}
```


- "`input`":
"`item`": the item's to be smelted full identifier;
"`data`": it's *aux value*. Default: `0`;
- *"`count`" is optional. It most likely has something to do with the number of items that can be smelted at the same time in a campfire, but it isn't documented anywhere.*
- "`output`": the item that the furnace outputs after smelting.


### Shaped recipe example
```jsonc
{
"format_version": "1.12",
"minecraft:recipe_shaped": {
"description": {
	"identifier": "minecraft:acacia_boat"
	},
"tags": [ "crafting_table" ],
"groups": [ "planks" ],
"pattern": [
				"#P#",
				"###"
				],
	"key": {
		"P": {
			"item": "minecraft:wooden_shovel"
		},
		"#": {
			"item": "minecraft:planks",
			"data": 4
			}
		},
"result": {
		"item": "minecraft:boat",
		"data": 4
		}
	}
}
```

- "`pattern`" consists of 3 rows each consisting of 3 character keys. Each character symbolizes an item in a slot of the crafting grid.
- "`key`" defines each character to mean an item. Here, 'P' means a Wooden Shovel and '`#`' means a '`planks`' block with aux value `4`, which is the Acacia Planks block.
- "`result`" means same as output. Here it's an Acacia Boat('`boat`' with aux id `4`).

Let's also look into a recipe that gives you more than one item as a result. 

```jsonc
{
  "format_version": "1.12",
  "minecraft:recipe_shaped": {
    "description": {
    "identifier": "minecraft:coal"
    },

    
    "tags": [ "crafting_table" ],
    "pattern": [
      "#"
    ],
    "key": {
      "#": {
        "item": "minecraft:coal_block"
      }
    },
    "result": {
      "item": "minecraft:coal",
      "data": 0,
      "count": 9
    }
  }
}
```

- "`count`" defines how many items you get when you craft this. Here you get 9 coal from deconstructing a coal block.

### Shapeless recipe example

```jsonc
{
"format_version": "1.12",
"minecraft:recipe_shapeless": {
"description": {
	"identifier": "minecraft:firecharge_coal_sulphur"
	},
 "priority": 0,
 "ingredients": {
	    "item": "minecraft:fireball",
	    "data": 0,
	    "count": 4
 },
"result": {
	    "item": "minecraft:blaze_powder",
	    "data": 4
	    }
	}
}
```

```jsonc
{
    "format_version": "1.12",
    "minecraft:crafting_shapeless": {
        "ingredients": [
            {
                "item": "minecraft:apple"
            },
            {
                "item": "minecraft:chest_minecart"
            },
            {
                "item": "minecraft:apple"
            }
        ],
        "result": {},
        "description": {
            "identifier": "tut:randomity_recipe"
        }
    }
}
```

- "`priority`" is the priority with which the recipe will be chosen over others.
- "`ingredients`" is simply a list of all ingredients with their aux values. There are no keys, since the ingredients can be placed in any crafting grid slot.

**Note: Crafting recipes can be generated visually online, check Links and Contact for a stable generator.**



***Challenge: Create custom crafting/smelting recipes for our custom blocks and items created in previous chapters!***

# Spawn Rules
Spawn rules define how vanilla Entities and custom entities spawn. In the next chapter we'll be creating a custom entity, so make sure to prepare a custom spawn rule for it! Check out the vanilla example files for more information. ;)

```jsonc
//BP/spawn_rules/zombie.json

{
  "format_version": "1.8.0",
  "minecraft:spawn_rules": {
    "description": {
      "identifier": "minecraft:zombie",
      "population_control": "monster"
    },
    "conditions": [
      {
        "minecraft:spawns_on_surface": {},
        "minecraft:spawns_underground": {},
        "minecraft:brightness_filter": {
          "min": 0,
          "max": 7,
          "adjust_for_weather": true
        },
        "minecraft:difficulty_filter": {
          "min": "easy",
          "max": "hard"
        },
        "minecraft:weight": {
          "default": 100
        },
        "minecraft:herd": {
          "min_size": 2,
          "max_size": 4
        },
        "minecraft:permute_type": [
          {
            "weight": 95
          },
          {
            "weight": 5,
            "entity_type": "minecraft:zombie_villager"
          }
        ],
        "minecraft:biome_filter": {
          "test": "has_biome_tag", "operator": "==", "value": "monster"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- "`description`">"`identifier`":  the entity to spawn
- "`population_control`": controls spawning and despawning quantities. Can be set to "`animal`", "`underwater_animal`", "`monster`" and "`ambient`".
- "`conditions`" are a list of conditions that have to be met in order for the spawn attempt to succeed.
- "`minecraft:spawns_on_surface`", "`minecraft:spawns_underground`" and "`minecraft:spawns_underwater`" control where the entity spawns cap-wise.
- "`minecraft_brightness_filter`" can be set from 0 to 15 and controls in which light levels can entities spawn. - "`adjust_for_weather`" defines whether it light levels are counted lower during rain or thunder weather.
- "`minecraft:difficulty_filter`" sets the range of level difficulty to enable this entity's spawns.
- "`minecraft:herd`" sets the number of entities spawning together, on the same spawn rule.
- "`minecraft:permute_type`" with "`weight`"s and "`entity_type`"s sets a chance for the spawned entity to mutate into a different one.
- And, lastly, "`minecraft:biome_filter`" tests for certain biome tags. Look up the filter syntax and list of biome tags in the documentation or search examples in the vanilla Example pack.


```jsonc
"minecraft:herd": {
          "min_size": 1,
          "max_size": 2,
          "event":"minecraft:entity_born",
          "event_skip_count": 1
        },
```

- "`minecraft:herd`" can also be used like this to make the second entity spawned [in this scenario] with the "`minecraft:entity:born`" (as baby). Can be used in any event.
`"event_skip_count": 2`, for example, means that the first two entities will not be spawned with this event, but all the next ones will.

*Why not create some more custom blocks, items, recipes and loot tables before moving onto the next big chapter?*
