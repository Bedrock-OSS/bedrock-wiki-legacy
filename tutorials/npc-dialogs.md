Non-Player Characters, or NPCs are villager-like entities that can be given a dialog with a message and multiple buttons. They were originally designed for use in adventure maps, but with the introduction of the `/dialogue` command, they can now be used in the context of a normal addon.

## Setup
Start by creating a manifest file if you do not already have one. This tutorial will only use the behavior pack, but you can add a resource pack if you would like. Make sure you change the UUIDs if you are using this in your own project.

{% include filepath.html path="manifest.json"%}
```json
{
    "format_version": 2,
    "header": {
        "name": "Dialog Command Demo",
        "description": "Demonstration of the new /dialogue command.",
        "uuid": "e8d51178-05b5-4b2e-9937-44950c902f18",
        "version": [0, 0, 1],
        "min_engine_version": [ 1, 16, 0 ]
    },
    "modules": [
        {
            "type": "data",
            "uuid": "ea36784a-d6ae-408e-bdff-c403b73135eb",
            "version": [0, 0, 1]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Dialog Files
NPC dialog data is stored in dialog files, which are stored in the `dialogue` folder in the root of the behavior pack. Here is a basic NPC dialog file:

{% include filepath.html path="dialogue/example.diag.json"%}
```json
{
  "format_version": "1.17",
  "minecraft:npc_dialogue": {
    "scenes": [
      {
        "scene_tag": "example",
        "npc_name": "Steve",
        "text": "Hello"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

In this file, there is an array of scenes. Each scene is a seperate dialog. You can put every dialog in one file, or you can put each one in a seperate file. Within each scene object are a number of properties that can be set to control the dialog:

#### scene_tag
The identifier of the scene, used to target the scene.

#### npc_name
The display name of the NPC. Optional, if it is not specified, the name of the NPC entity will be used, which is `§eNPC` by default.

#### text
The text to display in the speech bubble. Optional.

#### on_open_commands
Array of command strings to be run when the dialog is opened. Optional.
```json
"on_open_commands": [
  "/say Hello"
]
```

#### on_close_commands
Array of command strings to be run when the dialog is closed. Optional.

```json
"on_close_commands": [
  "/say Goodbye"
]
```

#### buttons
An array of objects specifying the buttons to show in the dialog. Optional.

```json
"buttons": [
  {
    "name": "Button One",
    "commands": [
      "/say Button One Pressed!"
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "Button Two",
    "commands": [
      "/say Button Two Pressed!",
      "/say Secondary Command for Button Two"
    ]
  }
]
```
## Selecting the Player
In `on_open_commands`, `on_close_commands`, and the `commands` property of each button object, you can use normal selectors, such as `@p` to select the nearest player. However, these selectors are run relative to the NPC entity, so this may be confusing in multiplayer. To solve this, there is a special selector, `@initiator` which always selects the player with the dialog open.

```json
"buttons": [
  {
    "name": "Levitation Please",
    "commands": [
      "/effect @initiator levitation"
    ]
  }
]
```

This selector **only** works within NPC dialogs, it cannot be used anywhere else.

## Translation
All of the dialog properties that will be displayed to the user can also be translated:

```json
"npc_name": {
  "rawtext": [
    {
      "translate": "entity.endermite.name"
    }
  ]
}
```
The translation key used should then be specified in the resource pack's `lang` files. In this case, `entity.endermite.name` would translate to "Endermite."

## Opening Dialogs
The `/dialog` command is used to open and control dialogs. The command looks like this: `/dialogue open <npc: target> <player: target> [sceneName:string]`
- `<npc: target>`: A selector pointing to any entity with the `minecraft:npc` component, such as the vanilla NPC. This determines where dialog commands are executed from, as well as the appearance of the NPC in the dialog.
- `<player: target>`: A selector pointing to the player who will see the dialog.
- `[sceneName:string]`: A string matching the `scene_tag` of the dialog to be shown. Optional, if not present, the last dialog shown by the NPC will be shown.

For example, the following command would open the dialog `example` for the nearest player, using the nearest NPC:
```mcfunction
/dialogue open @e[type=npc,c=1] @p example
```

## Changing Dialogs
The `/dialog` command is also used to change the dialog of an NPC. Unlike the `/dialog open` command, this command has no effect until a player opens the NPC dialog manually. This syntax looks like this: `/dialogue change <npc: target> <sceneName:string> [player: target]`
- `<npc: target>`: A selector pointing to the NPC to change the dialog of.
- `<sceneName:string>`: A string matching the `scene_tag` of the dialog to be shown.
- `[player: target]`: A selector pointing to the player who will see the updated dialog. Optional, if not present, all player will be affected.

For example, the following command would change the nearest NPC's dialog to `example` for a random player.
```
/dialogue change @e[type=npc,c=1] example @r
```

## Full Example
This full example will create a custom item that will allow the player to teleport when they right-click/interact while holding the item. Full source code for this example can be found [on Github](https://github.com/Llama-Studios/dialog-demo). For this demo, use the manifest file at the top of this page.

### Creating the NPC
Even if the NPC will never be visible, an NPC entity is always needed for the `/dialogue` command. To do this, you will need to summon the NPC and put it in a ticking area so that it is accesssible from anywhere:
{% include filepath.html path="functions/setup.mcfunction"%}
```
tickingarea add 0 1 0 0 2 0
summon npc "§r" 0 1 0
```

This function will create a ticking area at 0, 0, and spawn an NPC with no name in the bedrock layer in that ticking area. You will need to run this function once, either manually, or making use of `player.json` or `tick.json`.

### The Dialog File
This dialog file features two dialogs, each with two teleport buttons, and a button to switch between the two. 

{% include filepath.html path="dialogue/example.diag.json"%}
```json
{
  "format_version": "1.17",
  "minecraft:npc_dialogue": {
    "scenes": [
      {
        "scene_tag": "main_teleport_menu",
        "npc_name": "Teleport",
        "text": "Where would you like to teleport?",
        "buttons": [
          {
            "name": "Districts",
            "commands": [
              "/dialogue open @e[type=npc,c=1] @initiator districts_teleport_menu"
            ]
          },
          {
            "name": "My Base",
            "commands": [
              "/tp @initiator -20 4 -20"
            ]
          },
          {
            "name": "World Spawn",
            "commands": [
              "/tp @initiator 0 4 0"
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "scene_tag": "districts_teleport_menu",
        "npc_name": "District Teleport",
        "text": "What district would you like to teleport to?",
        "buttons": [
          {
            "name": "< Back",
            "commands": [
              "/dialogue open @e[type=npc,c=1] @initiator main_teleport_menu"
            ]
          },
          {
            "name": "Shop District",
            "commands": [
              "/tp @initiator 20 4 20"
            ]
          },
          {
            "name": "Gaming District",
            "commands": [
              "/tp @initiator 20 4 -20"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Creating the Item
Lastly, create an item that will open the dialog when right-clicked/interacted with. This item uses the Ender Pearl texture, but you could give it custom texture.

{% include filepath.html path="items/teleport_menu.json"%}
```json
{
  "format_version":"1.16.100",
  "minecraft:item":{
    "description":{
      "identifier":"dialog:teleport_menu",
      "category":"items"
    },
    "components":{
      "minecraft:on_use": {
        "on_use": {
          "event": "open_menu",
          "target": "self"
        }
      },
      "minecraft:foil": true,
      "minecraft:icon":{
         "texture":"ender_pearl"
      },
      "minecraft:display_name": {
         "value": "Teleport Menu"
      }
    },
    "events":{
      "open_menu":{
        "run_command":{
          "command":[
            "dialogue open @e[type=npc,c=1] @p main_teleport_menu"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Testing
When you are done, package these files along with the manifest, and import it into Minecraft. Start a new flat world, and make sure to enable cheats and experiments.

Once you are in the world, use `/function setup` to create the ticking area and NPC entity. Then use `/give @s dialog:teleport_menu` to give yourself the teleportation item. Switch to survival mode using `/gamemode s` (NPC dialogs do not work in Creative), hold the item, and right-click. You should see your dialog appear.
